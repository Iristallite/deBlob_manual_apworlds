  ## Level unlocks can be either shuffled or progressive.
  # levels_shuffled: true
  # levels_progressive: false
    # 11 individual level unlocks are shuffled into the item pool, along with 16 "Rocket Parts" and 12 "Color Energy Beam" McGuffins.
    # This mode is recommended for solo-slot and multiworld play.
    # It is recommended that you use the "Unlock all story levels" cheat on a fresh file, rather than a 100% file.
    # This is because certain pickups save permanently onto your file, leaving no ingame way to track them.
    # Here is a table of the "Unlock all story levels" cheats:
      # Wii     : hold C+Z,   then press 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1
      # PC/Xbox : hold LB+LT, then press Y X X Y Y X X Y (controller required)
      # PS3/4/5 : hold L1+L2, then press T S S T T S S T (*T*riangle/*S*quare)
      # Switch  : hold L+ZL,  then press X Y Y X X Y Y X
  # levels_shuffled: false
  # levels_progressive: true
    # All 31 levels unlock in sequential order via "Progressive Story Level" items.
    # This mode is recommended if you wish to integrate a standard-ish playthrough of de Blob 2 into an Archipelago multiworld.

  ## Traps! Oh no!
  # Low-framerate trap; set your FPS limit to 30 for the next 5 minutes.

  # Make sure to QUIT and then load your checkpoint, because RESTART restarts the entire level

  # You're banned from air-braking (B/RT/R2/T/ZR mid-air) for 5 minutes, considerably worsening the flow of gameplay.
  # You can still charge attack though, and if you get flung upwards due to porting jank (the "launch glitch"), you can still air-brake to avoid a potential softlock.

  # Invert the camera until you get another one!
  # There's an even number, so at the end you'll be back where you started.

  # At least it isn't 5 minutes like the other traps.
