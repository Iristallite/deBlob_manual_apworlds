  ## Level unlocks can be either shuffled or progressive.
  # levels_shuffled: true
  # levels_progressive: false
    # 30 individual level unlocks are shuffled into the item pool, along with 36 "Rocket Parts" McGuffins.
    # This mode is recommended for solo-slot and multiworld play.
    # You must use a 100% save file to use this mode.
    # Unfortunately, the ingame collectible counters are stuck at 100% if you replay a level, so you'll have to track externally.
    # I recommend using the chatbox in the AP client for counting Raydians, example: 123456789012345 for a level with 15 Raydians.
  # levels_shuffled: false
  # levels_progressive: true
    # All 31 levels unlock in sequential order via "Progressive Level" items.
    # This mode is recommended if you wish to integrate a standard playthrough of de Blob 2 (DS) into an Archipelago multiworld. 
  levels_shuffled: true
  levels_progressive: false
  # de Blob 2 features DSi exclusive content.
  # "true" will add the Chroma Cameras as checks and allow "cheats_chroma_crystal" to be set to true.
  # Recommended methods to play in DSi mode:
    # Plug the cartridge into a DSi or 3DS family system
    # Use TWiLight Menu on a DSi or 3DS family system
    # Configure the melonDS emulator to run in DSi mode
  dsi_enhanced: false
  # The Chroma Crystal lets you choose any color by pressing SELECT.
  # It also requires DSi Enhanced mode.
  cheats_chroma_crystal: false
  ## Traps! Oh no!
  # Low-resolution trap; set the emulator's resolution to 1x for the next level or play the next level on console.
  # Disable if playing entirely on console or not using emulator upscaling.
  traps_256x192: false
  # Generic restart level trap. Consider disabling in async multiworlds.
