  ## Level unlocks can be either shuffled or progressive.
  # levels_shuffled: true
  # levels_progressive: false
    # 28/29 individual level unlocks are shuffled into the item pool, along with 12 "Comrade Black's Blueprints" McGuffins.
    # This mode is recommended for solo-slot and multiworld play.
    # You must use a 100% save file or the "Unlock all levels" cheat on Wii (B B 1 2 1 2 B B at the main menu) to use this mode.
  # levels_shuffled: false
  # levels_progressive: true
    # All 28* levels unlock in sequential order via "Progressive Level" items.
    # This mode is recommended if you wish to integrate a standard playthrough of de Blob into an Archipelago multiworld.
    # This option is recommended if you cannot use a 100% save file,
    # or if you want to experience the natural level progression.
    # *Unfortunately this mode excludes 10-2 (Sinking Feeling) and 10-3 (Tower of Power)
  levels_shuffled: true
  levels_progressive: false
  # 10-2 (Sinking Feeling) has incredibly strict button-mash timing and is flat-out impossible at 30fps (handheld Switch)...
  # ...so you can fire it into a black hole with this option.
  # Set this to false if you're playing on a handheld Switch/Lite, can't mash fast enough/set up turbo.

  ## Traps! Oh no!
  # Low-framerate trap; set your FPS limit to 30 for the next 5 minutes.
  # Disable if you don't have a way to change the FPS limit mid-game (ie: gamescope on Linux or Special K on Windows).

  # Generic restart level trap. Consider disabling in async multiworlds.

  # You're banned from air-braking (B/RT/R2/ZR mid-air) for 5 minutes, considerably worsening the flow of gameplay.

  # Invert the camera until you get another one!
  # There's an even number, so at the end you'll be back where you started.

  # Much to the chagrin of lead composer John Guscott, you'll have to mute the music for 2 minutes.
  # At least it isn't 5 minutes like the other traps.
