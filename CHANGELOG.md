# [V2: The first public release](https://github.com/Iristallite/deBlob_manual_apworlds/releases/tag/release-V2)
Published: 2025-08-16 @ 00:34 UTC

After several days of work, a test-run in a short async with some friends, more work, a brief hiatus due to a heatwave, and a bit more work, the de Blob series apworlds have been released!

Please enjoy.  
Contains apworlds for:

* de Blob 1 (Console/PC)
* de Blob 2 (DS)
* de Blob 2 (DSi)
* de Blob 2 (Console/PC)  
Also includes a patch for the Steam version that fixes a nasty audio bug where Blob's "pain" sound will keep looping indefinitely.  
To apply, drag the `Data` folder from `deBlob2_Steam_AudioPatch.zip` directly into the `de Blob 2` game folder in `steamapps/common` and overwrite, wherever that is on your device.
<sup>The patch might work on the GOG version, but I only own the Steam version so I can't test.</sup>  
<sup>I am also aware that this is technically distributing game files, but all these files do is tell the game where and which sound effects to play, and as such I believe that no copyrighted assets are contained within.</sup>  
**If anything breaks with these, please either open an issue or send me a message on discord (iristallite)**  
<sup>hotfix 2025-08-19: add missing deathlink support to dB2 PC</sup>  
<sup>Hilariously, despite the new zip having `hotfix` in the name... I forgot to add the hotfixed apworld. OOPS</sup>
