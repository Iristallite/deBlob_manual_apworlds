# V3: The Great Options update!
Published: 2025-12-01 11:00 UTC

And now for something... more customizable!   
* Added many yaml options
  * Trap toggles
  * Cheat toggles
  * Pinky toggle
  * Shuffled/Progressive level modes
  * Option to remove the worst level in dB1 (10-2: Sinking Feeling)
* Renamed `Comrade Black's Plans` to `Comrade Black's Blueprints` for arbitrary reasons
* Renamed `+10 Minutes` to `Time Bonus`
* Removed the `INKT Informed` check since the trophy pops after beating the goal level
* Combined the DS and DSi versions of de Blob 2 into a single apworld with a DSi Enhanced™ toggle
* Actually fixed DeathLink being broken on the dB2 apworld <sup>(The V2 hotfix was identical to V2...)</sup>
* Fixed a few typos in the readme
* Tidied up my office

Shoutouts to [BigBradley](https://github.com/BigBradley)'s [Mario Kart 7 manual](https://github.com/BigBradley/Mario-Kart-7-Manual-APworld), which I referenced to set up the new yaml options!  

As always, the dB2 PC Audio Patch is included. Steam tested, GOG support not guaranteed.  
**I tested this by running 100 generations of 10 mixed-settings worlds, and got no gen failures!**  
**If anything breaks with the apworld, please either open an issue or send me a message on discord (iristallite)** 
<sup>Blob Party mode for *de Blob 2* coming eventually.</sup>

# [V2: The first public release](https://github.com/Iristallite/deBlob_manual_apworlds/releases/tag/release-V2)
Published: 2025-08-16 @ 00:34 UTC

After several days of work, a test-run in a short async with some friends, more work, a brief hiatus due to a heatwave, and a bit more work, the de Blob series apworlds have been released!

Please enjoy.  
Contains apworlds for:

* de Blob 1 (Console/PC)
* de Blob 2 (DS)
* de Blob 2 (DSi)
* de Blob 2 (Console/PC)  
Also includes a patch for the Steam version that fixes a nasty audio bug where Blob's "pain" sound will keep looping indefinitely.  
To apply, drag the `Data` folder from `deBlob2_Steam_AudioPatch.zip` directly into the `de Blob 2` game folder in `steamapps/common` and overwrite, wherever that is on your device.
<sup>The patch might work on the GOG version, but I only own the Steam version so I can't test.</sup>  
<sup>I am also aware that this is technically distributing game files, but all these files do is tell the game where and which sound effects to play, and as such I believe that no copyrighted assets are contained within.</sup>  
**If anything breaks with these, please either open an issue or send me a message on discord (iristallite)**  
<sup>hotfix 2025-08-19: add missing deathlink support to dB2 PC</sup>  
<sup>Hilariously, despite the new zip having `hotfix` in the name... I forgot to add the hotfixed apworld. OOPS</sup>
