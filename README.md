# deBlob_manual_apworlds
Manual apworlds for the de Blob Series, made with [Manual for Archipelago](https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago/Manual).

# How do I use this?
I will refer you to the offical [Archipelago setup guide](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en) for how to set up Archipelago.

Use the `Install APWorld` option in the Archipelago launcher to install the `.apworld` files from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Iristallite/deBlob_manual_apworlds/releases/latest)  
I have also provided some template `.yaml` files with the release.  
<sup>You can also just grab the `.apworld` and `.yaml` files from the folders, but I'd recommend sticking to the Releases for simplicity's sake.</sup>

de Blob and de Blob 2 are 3D platformers all about color!<sup>[sic][^1]</sup>  
<sup>I'm sorry if you're colorblind.</sup>

de Blob 1 is more open-ended; you can complete level challenges in any order, and the only thing blocking the exit is your score.  
de Blob 2 is more story-driven; you have to complete each level's missions in order.<sup>...unless you use speedrun skips</sup>  
de Blob 2 (DS/i) is a linear 2D platformer that still retains some gameplay elements from the console games.

# How does this manual apworld work, exactly?
...It doesn't! At least in terms of connecting to the game.<sup>well, duh, it's a *manual* apworld</sup>  
More seriously, you'll have to rely on 100% save files <sup>([dB1](https://www.speedrun.com/de_Blob/resources/m5gk0), [dB2](https://www.speedrun.com/dB2/resources/ezw7w), [dB2 DS(i)](https://www.speedrun.com/db2ds/resources/iix74))</sup> and/or [ingame cheats](#ingame-cheats) to affect the game directly.  
This apworld shuffles each level as an item, as well as a specific amount of "McGuffins" that you'll need to open the final level(s).  
In addition, there are some traps, cheats, upgrades (dB2), and some extra-special *diabolical traps* that are sure to ruin your day... if you're playing in a multiworld.<sup>...receiving a "Restart Level" *after* you beat a level kinda... entirely defeats the point, eh?</sup>  
Also there's DeathLink if you're into that.
# Wait, how does DeathLink work in a manual?
1. Locate the nearest source of damage or bottomless pit
2. Touch it until Blob dies and loses a life
3. Acknowledge you have received the deathlink by pressing the button in the client
4. If you continue from a game over in dB2, you should probably say goodbye to your S rank  
If you die accidentally, *you* send a deathlink to everyone else
# de Blob 1: Checks
* `Level Complete`: Complete the level.  
For Bonus Levels (`X-2`/`X-3`), I have arbitraily decided that you need to get a Gold Medal. You *can* ignore this, but I'll frown at you.
* `Gold Medal`: Self-explanatory.
* `100% Painted`: Paint *everything* in the level. If you can't find the last thing, try holding the Compass button!
* `Challenger`: Complete all *Challenges* within the level. This usually also gets you the `Architect` check (Landmarks Award) as well.
* `Speedrunner`: Beat the target *Time* listed under `(Main Menu) --> EXTRAS --> AWARDS --> (LEVEL)`. Stringing together combos is the key!
* `Stylist`: What a *style!* Collect them all!
* `Naturalist`: Save the *trees!* Restore them all!
* `Architect`: Shake! Shake! Shake! Restore all the *landmarks* INKT has defaced!
* `Street Artist`: You hate advertising, don't you? Tag all the *billboards!*
* `Transformer`: Optimus Paint Engine. Activate all the *Transform* Engines in each level; They spawn at certain Score intervals, and will always interrupt you with a skippable cutscene when they do.  
<sup>Yes, "Optimus Paint Engine." is the actual description of the trophy (called Transformers, I might add) that you get for doing this in every level.</sup>
* `Liberator`: They may take away our color, but they'll never take away our freedom! Free all the *Raydians* in each level from the Graydian suits the INKT Corporation has locked them in!
* `Blimp Painted`: To *blimp* and beyond! At certain points in each level, the Color Underground's *blimp* will appear. Tag it for a check!  
<sub>A bunch of these are references to the trophy descriptions in the HD re-release.</sub>
# de Blob 1: Items
#### Levels
* `X-X: LevelName`: Should be obvious. I'm not going to list all 30 of them.  
Note: `X-1` is the main level, while `X-2` and `X-3` are "Bonus Missions".
#### McGuffins
* `Comrade Black's Plans`: `9` out of `12` required to access `10-1 (Lake Raydia)` and beat the game.
#### Traps
* `Restart Level`: Press the `RESTART` button in the pause menu to restart the level. <sup>...Diabolical.</sup>
* `High-Performance Ink`: Cap the game at 30fps for 5 minutes. **If you're unable to change the FPS cap without restarting the game, *ignore this item.***
* `Broken Brakes`: For 5 minutes, you are not allowed to press Brake (`B`/`R2`/`RT`/`ZR`) to brake in mid-air.   
<sup>...wow that's a lot of different buttons</sup>  
You are still allowed to press Brake to crouch while on solid ground.  
* `Invert Camera`: Change the "Invert Camera" option to the *opposite* of your preference for 5 minutes, then change it back.
* `Free Lossless Ink Codec`: Turn the Music volume down to 0 for 2 minutes, then turn it back up.
#### Cheats
* `+10 Minutes`: Self-explanatory, refer to the table below.
* `Extra Life`: Self-explanatory, refer to the table below.
* `Temporary Invulnerability`: Each `Temporary Invulnerability` item is worth 30 seconds of the "Invulnerability" cheat being turned on.  
As an example, you can use 2 of them together for 1 minute of invulnerability.  
As an example of *how you could use this cleverly*, you can skip a certain section of `9-1 (Ministry of Ink)` by swimming through a pool of Ink while Invulnerability is on.
#### Shiny Filler
* `Color Wheel`: Named after the slightly uncommon collectible worth 1000 points, unfortunately this does nothing... but there are only `6` of them!~
# de Blob 2 (DS/i): Checks
* `Level Complete`: Complete the level.<sup>...pretty self-explanatory. again.</sup>
* `Musical Collector`: Maybe collecting the *3 big music notes* will save this game's terrible audio quality? <sup>It won't.</sup>
* `Liberator`: Rescue all the Raydians!
* `Chroma Camera`: Only present on certain levels *and* only in the DSi version, these do... well, nothing if they've already been collected on the save, otherwise you get a stupid but charming camera-gimmick minigame.  
Unfortunately, dB2 DS doesn't reset the in-level progress trackers if you replay from a 100% save, so... bust out the pen and paper!
# de Blob 2 (DS/i): Items
#### Levels
* `X-X: LevelName`: Should be obvious. I'm not going to list all 30 of them.
#### McGuffins
* `Rocket Parts`: `30` out of `36` required to access `7-1 (The Final Showdown)` and beat the game.
#### Traps
* `High-Resolution Ink`: Lower the internal resolution to 1x for 5 minutes. **If you're playing on a real console or not increasing the emulated IR, *ignore this item.***
* `Restart Level`: Press the `RESTART` button in the pause menu to restart the level. <sup>...Diabolical.</sup>
#### Shiny Filler
* `Big Music Note`: Named after the 3 big music notes in each level, unfortunately this does nothing... but there are only `6` of them!~
# de Blob 2: Checks
* `(LevelName) Liberated`: Not your typical "Level Complete" check; dB2 has a sort of "micro-postgame" in most of its levels!
You can tick off this check once you see the Pinky icon that lets you fast-travel between checkpoints and exit the level.
* `S Rank`: If you do *everything* in each level, (and don't get any Game Overs), you should easily get the S rank.
* `Trophies: Blob Survivor`: Simply complete a level without dying to earn this.<sup>...if you're playing with DeathLink on, *good luck.*</sup>
* `Trophies: INKT Informed`: Fill out "Pinky's Guide to Inkies" to earn this one. You'll need to play *all* the levels for it! (Or you can just !release after Hypno Ray I guess)  
<sup>If you already have the trophy or are playing on Wii/Switch/GOG, tick this off tick this off when you see Comrade Black's character portrait. (or a vertex explosion if you're playing on GOG/Steam)</sup>
* `Trophies: Piston Partisan`: In the level `State College`/`Comrade Black U.`, there are a few sections where you can chain together piston jumps. Do 10 in a row for the check!
* `Trophies: Pinky to the Rescue`: This is basically a free check.  
On console, connect a second controller and press whatever your platform equivalent of the `START` button is.  
On PC, press P on the keyboard, then you can control Pinky with the mouse!  
If you do some clever mapping with a gyro/touchpad-enabled controller, you can probably play as both Blob and Pinky simultaneously, which I imagine has quite some potential!
# de Blob 2: Items
* `Paradise Island`, `Downtown`, `Blanctown`, `The Senate`, `State College`, `Soda Falls`, `Hydro Station)`, `House of Fun`, `Orbital Habitats`, `Railyards`: Level unlocks.  
Please note that once `The Senate` is completed, the names on the level select for levels 5-10 (`State College`-`Railyards`) change due to story reasons.  
This only applies if you haven't cleared the respective level, however.  
The alternate names are provided in (brackets) in the manual tracker to prevent confusion.
#### McGuffins
* `Rocket Parts`: `12` out of `16` required to access `Rocket Range` and build the `Color Underground Rocket`.
* `Color Underground Rocket`: Received for completing `Rocket Range`. Required, alongside `7 Color Energy Beams`, to access the final level `Hypno Ray`.
* `Color Energy Beam`: `7` out of `12` required, alongside the `Color Underground Rocket`, to access the final level `Hypno Ray` and beat the game.
#### Traps
* `High-Performance Ink`: Cap the game at 30fps for 5 minutes. **If you're unable to change the FPS cap without restarting the game, *ignore this item.***
* `Broken Brakes`: For 5 minutes, you are not allowed to press Brake (`B`/`T`/`R2`/`RT`/`ZR`) to brake in mid-air, with two exceptions.  
<sup>...wow that's a lot of different buttons</sup>  
1: You are still allowed to press Brake to crouch while on solid ground.  
2: You are still allowed to press Brake immediately following a Charge Attack, as prevention against the *Launch Glitch.<sup>[^8]</sup>*
* `Invert Camera`: Change the "Invert Camera X/Y" options to the *opposite* of your preference for 5 minutes, then change them back.
* `Free Lossless Ink Codec`: Turn the Music volume down to 0 for 2 minutes, then turn it back up.
* `Pinky Short-Circuit`: Bans the use of the second player (Pinky) for 5 minutes. **If you're not playing with Pinky, *ignore this item.***
* `Restart Checkpoint`: Quit the level and enter it again from the menu. **DO NOT USE THE `RESTART` BUTTON IN THE PAUSE MENU; THAT WILL RESTART THE *ENTIRE LEVEL***
* `Restart Level`: Press the `RESTART` button in the pause menu to restart the level. <sup>...Diabolical.</sup>
#### Cheats
* `+10 Minutes`: Self-explanatory, refer to the table below.
* `Extra Life`: Self-explanatory, refer to the table below.
* `Armor Refill`: Self-explanatory, refer to the table below.
* `Chroma Crystal`: Semantics time! One "use" of this allows you to input the cheat *as many times as you need* until you're at the desired colour, *then* it's been "used up".
#### Shiny Filler
* `Big Color Atom`: Named after the common collectible worth 1000 points, unfortunately this does nothing... but there are only `3` of them!~

# Future Ideas
I'm also thinking of making a manual apworld for the original [*Utrecht School of the Arts **student project*** version of "De Blob"](https://archive.org/details/TheBlob_201501) (note the capital D).  
I don't have much in the way of "receivable items", but I could probably squeeze a few checks out of it.  
<sup>Sidenote: As if the Switch ports of the de Blob games weren't bad enough already, those bastards capitalized the *de!!!*</sup>  
With actual game integration, there are a few things we could do that we can't do right now.  
If a "Restart Level" trap is received, we could set lives to 0 and kill Blob to force a game over (I personally find dB1's game over sound hilarious)  
Traps that *lower* the timer, and a *diabolical trap* that sets the timer to something ridiculously low like 30 seconds, hope you can find a timer pickup!!!

[^1]: I'm Canadian and we spell it "colour", but since we get the same versions of games as the US, *all* of the games have a blatant "typo" everywhere (sigh)
[^2]: You can find the Wii version of de Blob 1 second-hand at retro game stores and on sites like eBay.
[^3]: The Xbox 360 version, strangely enough, is backwards compatible with Xbox One and Series X/S consoles.  
If you can get Xbox Live sign-in to work on your 360, it'll still show up in your purchase history if you buy the BC version... for now at least.  
Source: I did this with the Banjo-Kazooie games so I could play them on a CRT
[^4]: I'm pretty sure the PS3 version of de Blob 2 is still available to purchase, but you'll need to add funds via the PSN website (or a PS4/PS5) and then visit the store on an actual PS3 to find it.
[^5]: THQ shut down the developer Helixe mid-production.  
There is a prototype ROM floating about, but it's too unstable for me to consider an apworld for it, and it would probably also get flagged for piracy in the official Archipelago discord.
[^6]: I do own the iOS version, and I know it was still listed as late as 2017, so maybe it'll still show up if you search for it on a device running iOS 10 or older?
[^7]: Same situation with dB1 mobile where I own the iOS version but not a device old enough to run it.
[^8]: The *Launch Glitch* depends on *your PC's hardware* ***and*** *which level you're playing.* For example, it happens in Rocket Range on my PC, but not in the same level on my Steam Deck.
